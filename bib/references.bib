  abstract ={This paper proposes an LLM-based grading system that addresses the entire grading procedure, including the following key components: (1) developing grading rubrics that not only consider the questions but also the student answers, which can more accurately reflect students' performance; (2) under the guidance of grading rubrics, providing accurate and consistent scores for each student, along with customized feedback; (3) conducting post-grading review to better ensure accuracy and fairness.},

@article{Yeung2025ZeroShot,
  abstract = {This study introduces a Zero-Shot Large Language Model (LLM)-Based Automated Assignment Grading (AAG) system. The framework leverages prompt engineering to evaluate both computational and explanatory student responses without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The AAG system delivers tailored feedback that highlights individual strengths and areas for improvement, thereby enhancing student learning outcomes. Comprehensive evaluations, including survey responses from higher education students, indicate significant improvements in motivation, understanding, and preparedness compared to traditional grading methods. The results validate the AAG system's potential to transform educational assessment by prioritizing learning experiences and providing scalable, high-quality feedback.},

@article{Policar2025Bioinformatics,
  abstract = {Providing students with individualized feedback through assignments is a cornerstone of education that supports their learning and development. Studies have shown that timely, high-quality feedback plays a critical role in improving learning outcomes. However, providing personalized feedback on a large scale in classes with large numbers of students is often impractical due to the significant time and effort required. Recent advances in natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling the efficient delivery of personalized feedback. These technologies can reduce the workload of course staff while improving student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Their successful implementation, however, requires thorough evaluation and validation in real classrooms.
We present the results of a practical evaluation of LLM-based graders for written assignments in the 2024/25 iteration of the Introduction to Bioinformatics course at the University of Ljubljana. Over the course of the semester, more than 100 students answered 36 text-based questions, most of which were automatically graded using LLMs. In a blind study, students received feedback from both LLMs and human teaching assistants without knowing the source, and later rated the quality of the feedback. We conducted a systematic evaluation of six commercial and open-source LLMs and compared their grading performance with human teaching assistants. Our results show that with well-designed prompts, LLMs can achieve grading accuracy and feedback quality comparable to human graders. Our results also suggest that open-source LLMs perform as well as commercial LLMs, allowing schools to implement their own grading systems while maintaining privacy.},

@article{Hovsepian2024Calibration,
  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed as crowdsourced annotators to alleviate the burden of human labeling. However, the broader adoption of LLM-based automated labeling systems encounters two main challenges: (1) LLMs are prone to producing unexpected and unreliable predictions, and (2) no single LLM excels at all labeling tasks. To address these challenges, we leverage calibrated confidence scores to design a cost-aware cascading LLM ensemble policy which achieves improved accuracy while reducing inference cost by more than 2 times compared with the conventional weighted majority voting ensemble policy.},

@article{Geng2024Survey,
  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks in various domains. Despite their impressive performance, they can be unreliable due to factual errors in their generations. Assessing their confidence and calibrating them across different tasks can help mitigate risks and enable LLMs to produce better generations. There has been a lot of recent research aiming to address this, but there has been no comprehensive overview to organize it and outline the main lessons learned. The present survey aims to bridge this gap. In particular, we outline the challenges and we summarize recent technical advancements for LLM confidence estimation and calibration. We further discuss their applications and suggest promising directions for future work.}，

@inproceedings{Malik2019GenerativeGrading,
  abstract = {Access to high-quality education at scale is limited by the difficulty of providing student feedback on open-ended assignments in structured domains like programming, graphics, and short response questions. This problem has proven to be exceptionally difficult: for humans, it requires large amounts of manual work, and for computers, until recently, achieving anything near human-level accuracy has been unattainable. In this paper, we present generative grading: a novel computational approach for providing feedback at scale that is capable of both accurately grading student work while also providing verifiability—a property where the model is able to substantiate its claims with a provable certificate.}，
