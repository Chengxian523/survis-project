        "abstract": "This study compares how the generative AI (GenAI) large language model (LLM) ChatGPT performs in grading university exams compared to human teachers. Aspects investigated include consistency, large discrepancies, and length of answer. Implications for higher education, including the role of teachers and ethics, are also discussed. Three Master's-level exams were scored using ChatGPT 3.5, and the results were compared with the teachers' scoring, and the grading teachers were interviewed.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks in various domains. Despite their impressive performance, they can be unreliable due to factual errors in their generations. Assessing their confidence and calibrating them across different tasks can help mitigate risks and enable LLMs to produce better generations. There has been a lot of recent research aiming to address this, but there has been no comprehensive overview to organize it and outline the main lessons learned. The present survey aims to bridge this gap. In particular, we outline the challenges and we summarize recent technical advancements for LLM confidence estimation and calibration. We further discuss their applications and suggest promising directions for future work.}\uff0c",

However, the broader adoption of LLM-based automated labeling systems encounters two main challenges: (1) LLMs are prone to producing unexpected and unreliable predictions, and (2) no single LLM excels at all labeling tasks. To address these challenges, we leverage calibrated confidence scores to design a cost-aware cascading LLM ensemble policy which achieves improved accuracy while reducing inference cost by more than 2 times compared with the conventional weighted majority voting ensemble policy.",

In this paper, we present generative grading: a novel computational approach for providing feedback at scale that is capable of both accurately grading student work while also providing verifiability\u2014a property where the model is able to substantiate its claims with a provable certificate.}\uff0c",

        "abstract": "Providing students with individualized feedback through assignments is a cornerstone of education that supports their learning and development. Studies have shown that timely, high-quality feedback plays a critical role in improving learning outcomes. However, providing personalized feedback on a large scale in classes with large numbers of students is often impractical due to the significant time and effort required. Recent advances in natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling the efficient delivery of personalized feedback. These technologies can reduce the workload of course staff while improving student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Their successful implementation, however, requires thorough evaluation and validation in real classrooms. We present the results of a practical evaluation of LLM-based graders for written assignments in the 2024/25 iteration of the Introduction to Bioinformatics course at the University of Ljubljana. Over the course of the semester, more than 100 students answered 36 text-based questions, most of which were automatically graded using LLMs. In a blind study, students received feedback from both LLMs and human teaching assistants without knowing the source, and later rated the quality of the feedback. We conducted a systematic evaluation of six commercial and open-source LLMs and compared their grading performance with human teaching assistants. Our results show that with well-designed prompts, LLMs can achieve grading accuracy and feedback quality comparable to human graders. Our results also suggest that open-source LLMs perform as well as commercial LLMs, allowing schools to implement their own grading systems while maintaining privacy.",
